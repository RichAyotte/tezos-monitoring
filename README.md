# Tezos Monitoring Tools
Tools to monitor your Tezos Node, Baker and Endorser

**blockheight.sh**: monitor if your node is up to date with the chain, by comparing your node's block height with network block height as published by TZscan.io's API (http://tzscan.io/api)

PS: If you are baking with the ledger, these fine folks have created systemd entries to make it easier to run the node/baker/endorser:
